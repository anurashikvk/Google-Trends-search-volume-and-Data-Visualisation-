# Google Trends and Time Series Data Integration

## Overview

Explore the fascinating intersections between Google Trends data and other time series datasets. By combining search volumes with various time-dependent variables, we aim to uncover valuable insights into different aspects of the world. Throughout this project, we will focus on three main analyses:

1. **Bitcoin Analysis:**
   - Examine how the search volume for "Bitcoin" correlates with the actual price of Bitcoin.

2. **Tesla Stock Analysis:**
   - Investigate the relationship between search volume for Tesla and its corresponding stock price.

3. **Unemployment Trends:**
   - Analyze how searches for "Unemployment Benefits" fluctuate in response to changes in the actual unemployment rate in the United States.

## Learning Objectives

This project will provide hands-on experience in the following key areas:

- **Time Series Data Manipulation:**
  - Techniques to make time-series data comparable through resampling and conversion to a common periodicity.

- **Matplotlib Styling:**
  - Fine-tuning chart aesthetics, including adjusting limits, labels, linestyles, markers, colors, and resolution.

- **Seasonality Visualization:**
  - Use grids to visually identify seasonality patterns in time series data.

- **Handling Missing Data:**
  - Methods to identify and handle missing and NaN values in a DataFrame.

- **Time Axis Styling:**
  - Work with Locators to enhance the styling of the time axis on charts for better readability.

- **Application of Previous Concepts:**
  - Apply concepts learned in the previous sessions to analyze and visualize new datasets effectively.
